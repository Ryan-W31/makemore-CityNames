# DinoNames

DinoNames takes in a single .csv file filled with 1000+ real dinosaur names and uses machine learning models to predict new ones.

This repository was inspired by and follows along with Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) youtube playlist.

Models implemented:

- [Bigram and Trigram](bigram.ipynb) - Character-Level Language Model 
- [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)](mlp.ipynb) - Character-Level Language model
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Transformer
